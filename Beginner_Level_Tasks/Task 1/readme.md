# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION PROJECT

    This project is particularly reffered as "HELLO WORLD" of Machine Learning.The Iris Dataset contains numeric attributes, 
    and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since
    this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities
